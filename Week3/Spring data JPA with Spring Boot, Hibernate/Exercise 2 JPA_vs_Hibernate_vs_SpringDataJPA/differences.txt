Differences between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA:

1. JPA (Java Persistence API):
- Specification, not an implementation
- Provides a set of interfaces
- Needs provider like Hibernate

2. Hibernate:
- Implementation of JPA
- Includes additional features beyond JPA
- Widely used ORM framework

3. Spring Data JPA:
- Abstraction over JPA and Hibernate
- Simplifies CRUD and database operations
- Uses repositories with no boilerplate code
